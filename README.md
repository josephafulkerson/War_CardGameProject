This first Flatiron school project is a game similar to the classic card game War!

The user will be playing with a full deck of 52 cards. The user will be playing 1 v 1 against the bot. Each round will allow the user to score a total of 1 point. After all cards are exhausted, the player with the most points is declared the winner. The user will then be able to initiate a new round.
