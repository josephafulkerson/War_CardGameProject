For our first Flatiron Project, our group will be creating a virtual version of the classic card game 'War!' 

The user will be playing with a full deck of 52 cards. The user will be playing 1 v 1 against the bot. Each round will allow the user to score a total of 1 point. After all cards are exhausted, the player with the most points is declared the winner. The user will then be able to initiate a new round. 

Will be expanding to more advanced features in later versions. Updates may include additional games such as Blackjack, bot dialogue, a betting system with virtual currency,  interactive sounds, a detailed table, and multiple players.
